MATLAB files relevant to quantify the nuclear to cytosolic signal intensity (NCI) from an image (e.g. from an immunofluorescence).

Used for YAP-TAZ in the paper Fasciani et al., to appear in Nature Genetics

Runs in Matlab R2015a. 

Please cite the proper related publication in case you use the routines or some of the code. 

Please also note that many functions were developed by other research groups, as stated in the code: if possible cite also them, when appropriate. 

The script Example_NCI_broad_givenFolder.m allows to calculate nuclear and cytosolic signals for each cell in a given image of which the nuclear and protein of interet signals are given in two separate tif files.

The results of nuclear and cytosolic intensities, as well as other quantities of interests, are provided in the resulting mat file, from which NCI can be readily computed.  

JPGs showing the results of the calculations are also provided as output. 

Thank you
